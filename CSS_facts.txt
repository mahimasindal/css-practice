css resources:-

1) for Units : https://css-tricks.com/css-font-size/#:~:text=Here's%20the%20scoop%3A%201em%20is,body%2C%20then%201em%20%3D%2020px.
	rems and ems:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-aDOAMmDHI

px-used for fixed units
keywords used for compound and mixed
em-used for compunding effect
rem-set root(html) and everything else will be relative to that

-in terms of font size if a div is given 2 em it will look at it's parent and multiply it's font size with 2
 but for padding and margins the font-size of the same div is referred and compounding happens based on that.
  for eg:- div{ font-size : 2em; padding: 2em} then padding is actually 2em*2em = 4em.
-same is not the case in rem. There it checks font size of root(html) and multiplies it.

-for padding we generally use em so things grow proportionately
- for margins we use rem so the spacing between divs is consistent
- to make maths easier we set root elements font as 62.5% that makes it 10px and now it's easier to do calculations.

-for width - % vw ch max-width
-height - min height
-media queries-em


2)Inheritance in css
-color is inherited 
-form elements donot inherit colors
